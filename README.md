## My Contributions
My role was to integrate nVidia PhysX 4.0 into the project and create a physics engine that communicates with PhysX and the rest of the components of the game. I had to implement vehicles and tune the driving model to the feeling and handling we wanted. I also did all the programming for the traps, pickup boxes, winning/losing conditions and logic, lap system, race ranking (1st, 2nd), drivable track that matches the obj mesh, placement of the track traps and their behaviour. 

While not fully represented by commits I also had various minor contributions to the camera, player mesh, pickup box and trap mesh, track mesh, vehicle AI, vehicle driving targets, vehicle AI components such as the shooting and trap placement, the audio system, in game HUD, and the rendering system.

## Biggest Challenge
Reading and learning how PhysX worked and how to integrate it into the rest of the project. I had never used any external library before and there aren't many tutorials (at all) for PhysX, so this project taught me how to look at documentation and integrate it into my own project. This was also a great learning experience for working with other people on a large project and how to read over other peoples code and understand it, even when there is a lack of commenting. I also gained a ton of experience in using Git and merging multiple changes at once without conflicts.

A project made by CPSC undergrads at the University of Calgary for the course CPSC 585


## Install
Donwload the Repository to your computer either by downloading the zip or git cloning. 

If you just want the playable (no source code), the zip file "gameReleaseExe.zip" contains a built executable. Simply download this file, unzip it and run the exe file contained within the folder


## Usage
Press on the executable file, or open in Visual Studio (working currently on the 2017 and 2019 version) and run the project

## Game Instructions

Note the game can only be controlled by Xbox 360 or Xbox one controllers, offically supported by Microsoft. Controls will be shown in game. But here is a list of them

- RT = accelerate
- LT = brake/reverse
- RB/LB = fire turret
- LS = steer
- RS = aim
- click RS = re center camera
- B = handbrake
- Y = look behind
- Dpad = use shield weapon systems
- Start (or options) = pause

# Premise
- You have been a prisoner in Elonville for quite some time now. However through emperor Tesla's grace, you and other select prisoners have been given a chance at freedom with the Tesla Games! There is no 1st, 2nd, 3rd; only a single winner and many losers. Win by either being the first to complete the laps, or by being the last one standing. Can you survive the machinations of The Tesla Games and the other racers? Really? Prove it.

# Features
- Single player mode that has you face against AI racers. Choose the amount of AI to race against and between two daunting tracks. 
- Multiplayer mode for split screen co-op. No Ai racers in this mode, this is a showdown between human racers only.

# Tips and tricks
- Each cybertruck drives identically, racers are seperated based on their skill alone.
- Each cybertruck come equipped with a standard solar Mark II turret, that can be independantly aimed from the vehicles direction.
- Each cybertruck comes with the ability to deploy EMP Caltrop mines, Electrified oil slick and nanite smoke screens. Courtesy of the SpaceX shield system.
  - The caltrops deal heavy damage to other vehicles. Affects AI or human.
  - The oil slick spins the vehicle out, and makes it harder to control the vehicle temporarily. Affects AI or Human.
  - The smoke screen disables your weapon systems both turret and sheild temporarily. Affects AI or human.
- Pickup boxes will appear on the track, afterall the emperor is quite bored and wants to have a show. Red boxes will give you turret ammo, wheras blue boxes allow for a use of the shield system.
- The emperor thought the games as is were too easy, and so through his infinite wisdom has placed versions of the sheild traps throughout the track that can appear at anytime. These look like a redder shade of the normal shield traps, and will **not** affect AI racers. However, they will mercilessly harm any human racer unfortunate to corss them. How's that for shifting the odds in your favour?

Either be the first to complete all the laps, or be the last one standing.
